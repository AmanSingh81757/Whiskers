    <h1>WHISKERS</h1>
    <h3>Where every pet finds its forever home</h3> <br>
    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="intro para">
        <br> <br>
        <p>Whiskers is a non profitable organisation which aims to provide shleter to homeless animals and give them a new ray of hope. Through this initiative we have given new homes to 100 pets. These include animals like dogs, cats, parrots, squirrel and hamsters. As of today our work is limited to the city of Faridabad but we hope to expand this organisation to different cities very soon. As a fellow animal lover I request you to anopt an animal today and be the reason to put a smile on it's cute face. It's completely free of cost and brings you abundance of joys.
        <br>
        We understand that adopting a pet is a big responsibility, which is why we strive to provide you with all the information and support you need to make the best decision for you and your new companion. Our adoption process is designed to ensure that every pet is placed in a loving and suitable home.
        <br>
        We believe that every animal deserves a second chance, and we work hard to match each pet with the perfect forever home. Whether you're looking for a new addition to your family or just want to help a furry friend in need, we have something for everyone at WHISKERS

    <h2>OUR AIM</h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="aim">
        <p>Our main aim is to provide a shelter to stray animals and pets who are abandoned by their owners.
            According to a report by economics time India has the highest number of homeless stray animals and highest number of pet abandonment in the whole world. <br>
            This is not only a problem for the poor animals but also for people, as these stray animals are one of the major contributors of accidents in our country. By giving them a proper shelter and proper care we can control their overgrowing population and prevent many roadside accidents. <br>
            We at Whiskers love animals and we try our very best to give these animals a new home and for some a second chance at life. Starting from Faridabad, we wish to expand the idea and inspire more people to help stray animals and pets and raise awarness about this topic. <br>
            Hence we request you to support us in our journey to save countless lives by giving your furry friend a new home or by donating desired money.
